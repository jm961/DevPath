This is because limiting the amount of data that is returned reduces the amount of sensitive information that is exposed. By only returning the necessary data, you can help prevent security vulnerabilities such as data leakage, injection attacks, and other types of attacks that rely on exposing too much information. Additionally, reducing the amount of data returned can improve the performance of your API by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and transmitted.</p></main>
