This can prevent attacks such as content spoofing or injection, where an attacker tries to trick the server into processing malicious content by pretending that it is of a different content type. By forcing the content-type to a specific format, the server can validate that the data it is receiving is legitimate and safe to process. Additionally, forcing the content-type can help prevent certain types of parsing errors that could be exploited by attackers.</p></main>
