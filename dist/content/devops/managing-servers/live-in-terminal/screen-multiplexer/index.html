Each virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition, several control functions from the ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text regions between windows.</p><p>See <code>man screen</code> or <code>screen -h</code> for further information</p><p>Visit the following resources to learn more:</p><ul><li><a href=https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/screen.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target=_blank>Screen Cheat Sheet</a></li><li><a href=https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target=_blank>Screen Users Manual</a></li></ul></main>
