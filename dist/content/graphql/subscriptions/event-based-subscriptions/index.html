These events can be triggered by external sources such as user actions, sensor data, or other systems, or by internal actions such as database updates.</p><p>With event-based subscriptions, the client can subscribe to a specific event or set of events and receive updates in real-time as soon as the event occurs. This allows the client to receive notifications about important changes in the system without the need to constantly poll the server for updates.</p></main>
