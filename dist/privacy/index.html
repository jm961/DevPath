It explains what we collect, how we use it, and when we share it. Your use of DevPath is also governed by our <a href=/terms>Terms of Service</a>, which incorporate this Privacy Policy. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meanings given in the Terms of Service.</p><h2 id=coverage-of-this-privacy-policy>Coverage of this Privacy Policy</h2><p>This Policy describes how we handle personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”) we collect when you use the Platform. It doesn’t apply to services we don’t own or control. We collect different categories of Personal Data to operate and improve the Platform, create and manage accounts, communicate with you, fulfill requests, and analyze usage. We only share Personal Data as described in this Policy.</p><p>Consistent with our Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not register or send us Personal Information. If we learn that we’ve collected information from a child under 13, we will delete it. If you believe a child has provided us information, contact us at <a href=mailto:contact@devpath.sh>contact@devpath.sh</a>.</p><h2 id=can-devpathsh-modify-this-privacy-policy>Can devpath.sh modify this Privacy Policy?</h2><p>We’re always improving our Services, so we may update this Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we’ll post updates on the site and/or notify you by service notifications, email, or other reasonable means. Legal notices are effective whether or not you read them, even if you’ve disabled legal-notice emails or haven’t provided an email address. Your continued use of the Services after changes take effect means you accept the updated Policy. The then-current Policy applies to all information we have.</p><h2 id=what-data-does-devpathsh-gather>What data does devpath.sh gather?</h2><p>Information you provide directly:</p><p>We collect and store information you choose to give us. During sign up and in account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, role, email, phone number, and credentials for third‑party platforms (for example, Twitter). If you connect a third‑party account or authenticate through it, certain content or information from that account (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transferred to your account with us, subject to your authorization. That information is covered by this Policy. Some details may be required to register or to use specific features.</p><p>We may contact you using the details you provide. For example, if you share your email, we may send product updates or partner offers, and we may track email opens to improve our communications. You can opt out of non‑essential emails by writing to <a href=mailto:contact@devpath.sh>contact@devpath.sh</a>.</p><h2 id=automatically-gathered-information>Automatically Gathered Information</h2><p>When you use the Services, our servers automatically receive information from your browser or device, such as IP address, approximate location, device identifiers, cookie data, browser/device type, and the pages or features you request. Cookies are identifiers we place on your browser or device so we can recognize it and understand how and when the Services are used. You can adjust your browser/device settings to block or limit cookies, but some features may not work properly. Our advertising partners may also set cookies when you interact with ads, and third‑party sites you visit may set their own cookies. This Policy does not cover third‑party cookie practices.</p><p>We use the usage data described above only in aggregated, non‑identifying form (for example, to understand feature usage and improve the Services).</p><h2 id=does-devpathsh-distribute-collected-personal-information>Does devpath.sh distribute collected Personal Information?</h2><p>We may share your Personal Information with third parties as follows:</p><p>De‑identified data: We may remove identifying details from Personal Information and share that anonymized data with partners. We may also share aggregate usage statistics so partners can understand how people use the Services. We never share aggregate data in a way that identifies you personally.</p><h2 id=information-collected-automatically>Information Collected Automatically</h2><p>Each time you interact with the Services, we may automatically collect log and device information as described above (e.g., IP address, geolocation, device IDs, cookie data, browser/device type, requested pages or features). You can manage cookie preferences in your browser or device, though some features may be unavailable if cookies are disabled. Ad networks may use web beacons or cookies for auditing, research, reporting, and to deliver targeted ads on other sites. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies, which this Policy does not cover. We use such usage information only in aggregate, non‑identifying form.</p><p>When we collect the usage information described above, we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.</p><h2 id=will-devpathsh-share-any-of-the-personal-information-it-receives>Will devpath.sh Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</h2><p>We may share Personal Information with third parties as described below:</p><p>Information that is no longer personally identifiable: We may anonymize Personal Information and provide it to partners. We may also share aggregate usage information so partners can understand how often and in what ways people use the Services. We do not disclose aggregate information in a way that personally identifies you.</p><p>Advertisers: We may allow advertisers or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to target ads or offers to specific audience segments. We may provide non‑identifying information to help them select an appropriate audience. For example, we might use your general location to show local offers, but we won’t disclose who you are. If you respond to a targeted ad, the advertiser may infer you belong to the targeted audience.</p><p>Web beacons: We may deliver a “web beacon” file from an ad network through the Services to enable anonymized, aggregated auditing, research, and reporting and to help serve targeted ads on other websites. Because your browser requests these assets from the ad network’s servers, those companies can read or set their own cookies. You may be able to opt out of such tracking by changing your browser settings.</p><p>Affiliated businesses: At times, we may partner with or be affiliated with third‑party businesses that offer products or services through or alongside the Services. When you engage in such a transaction or service, we will share your Personal Information with the affiliated business only as needed for that purpose. For example, you might sign in to your devpath.sh account using your Twitter account. Please review the privacy policies of any third‑party website or business you interact with.</p><p>Our agents: We engage vendors and service providers to perform tasks for us and may share Personal Information with them as needed to provide products or services to you. Our agents are not permitted to use Personal Information for purposes beyond providing assistance to us.</p><p>User profiles and submissions: Some profile information—such as your name, location, and any content you upload—may be visible to other users to enable interaction within the Services or to fulfill your requests. Content you post publicly (e.g., on discussion boards or in public messages) is visible to others and may be collected and used by anyone. Your username may be shown to other users when you send messages or post content, and others may contact you through the Services. If you sign in via a social network, your list of “friends” may be imported, and those friends who also use the Services may have access to certain non‑public profile information. We do not control third‑party sites or services.</p><p>Business transfers: We may buy or sell assets, and user information is typically transferred as part of such transactions. Personal Information may also be transferred to a third party in the event of an acquisition, bankruptcy, insolvency, or other change of control.</p><p>Protection of devpath.sh and others: We may access, preserve, and disclose information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with law or court orders; enforce our terms and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of devpath.sh, our employees, users, or others.</p><h2 id=is-personal-information-about-me-secure>Is Personal Information about me secure?</h2><p>Your account is protected by a password (and, where applicable, third‑party sign‑in protections). Help keep your account secure by choosing a strong password, protecting your credentials, and signing out when finished. We work to safeguard the privacy of your account and other Personal Information in our records, but no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. Unauthorized access, hardware/software failure, or other events could compromise user information.</p><h2 id=what-personal-information-can-i-access>What Personal Information can I access?</h2><p>From your account settings, you can access and, in some cases, edit or delete information you’ve provided, including:</p><ul><li>first and last name</li><li>location of residence</li><li>age or birthday</li><li>username</li></ul><p>Available options may change as the Services evolve. For questions about viewing or updating your information, email us at <a href=mailto:contact@devpath.sh>contact@devpath.sh</a>.</p><p>Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83–1798.84, California residents may request a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information we share with affiliates and/or third parties for marketing and the relevant contact information for those entities. To request this notice, email <a href=mailto:contact@devpath.sh>contact@devpath.sh</a>.</p><h2 id=what-choices-do-i-have>What choices do I have?</h2><p>You can choose not to provide information, but some data may be required to register or use certain features.</p><p>You may add, update, or delete information as described above. We may retain copies of earlier versions in our records. You may request deletion of your account by contacting <a href=mailto:contact@devpath.sh>contact@devpath.sh</a>; we will disassociate your email address and Twitter account from content or other information you provided. Some information may remain in our records after deletion. We may use aggregated data derived from your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a way that identifies you personally.</p><h2 id=what-if-i-have-questions-about-this-policy>What if I have questions about this policy?</h2><p>If you have questions or concerns about these practices, email a detailed message to <a
